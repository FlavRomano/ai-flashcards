# Evolutionary II
##  Genetic algorithm #card  
- Is a **general purpose protocol**
	- based on a population
	- mutations are **rare**
	- driven by **recombination**

### What represents an individual? #card 
- Each individual is represented by a **BIT STRING** called **CHROMOSOME**
	- represents the individual genotype
		- e.g $0100$ 
	- it's the internal representation
		- is manipulated during mutation and crossover

### What's a phenotype? #card 
Given a genotype,
- a phenotype is what the genotype builds 
	- e.g genotype $0100$, phenotype: $$01=blue,\quad00=elephant$$
- it is the external expression 
	- that interacts with the environment 
	- and gets evaluated

### What's the core loop of Genetic Algorithm? #card 
1. Selection
2. Crossover
3. Mutation

#### How selection phase works? #card 
- From the population
	- pick parents based on a fitness function $$P:p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$$

##### Which type of selection is used? #card 
- Comma selection
	- the $\mu$ best kids will replace the parents

#### How crossover phase works? #card 
- Is the process of combining the genetic information of two parents 
	- to produce new offspring
- It simulates biological reproduction to mix traits
	- hoping the children inherit the best parts of both parents.

##### How 1-point crossover works? #card 
- Choose $k\in[0,\#\text{chromosomes})$ 
- you cut both parents at $k$ spot and swap the tails

##### How 2-point crossover works? #card 
- Choose $k_1,k_2\in[0,\#\text{chromosomes})$ 
- you cut both parents at two spots and swap the **middle segment** only.![[Pasted image 20260105174405.png]]

#### Why input encoding is crucial? #card 
- Input encoding is something related to the domain
- One wrong input encoding could make the problem unsolvable
	- e.g hamming cliff considering binary encoding for integers $$[0,15]\to [0000,1111]$$

##### What's hamming cliff? #card 
- Mutation are rare in Genetic Algorithms
- Moving from 7 to 8 requires **a lot of mutations** $$7=0111, \;8 = 1000$$
	- flipping all bits
	- so it makes **statistically impossible** to mutate from 7 to 8
	- that's not good

#### What's direct encoding? #card 
- When each element in the genotype
	- maps **a feature in the phenotype** 
	- e.g 3 phenotype feature $$\underbrace{\overbrace{00}^{feature}\;11\;10}_{genotype}$$

##### What's the problem of direct encoding? #card 
- It's too simple
- For each phenotype feature we have a genotype representation
- Scales bad
	- e.g a separate DNA code for
		- each finger
		- each eye
		- each arm...

#### What's indirect encoding? #card 
- Indirect encoding allows modularity and symmetry
- Encodes the **rules** for the developments of phenotype
	- one encoding that when expressed can lead to the development of several parts
