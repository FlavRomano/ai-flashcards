# Planning
## What's the aim of classical planning?
?
Finding a sequence to actions to accomplish a goal.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

### Classical Planning assumes the environment is discrete, static, fully-observable, and [BLANK].
?
Deterministic, otherwise the same sequence of actions will NOT lead to the goal.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

## What is the standard definition language used in Classical Planning?
?
Programming Domain Definition Language (PDDL)
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

### Why classical planning use PDDL?
?
Is a human-readable way to describe initial states, goals, and actions
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

### Which assumptions PDDL do?
?
1. Closed-world assumption
2. Unique names assumption
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,274-->

### What does  a PDDL program return?
?
Returns a plan.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,274-->

### What's a plan in PDDL?
?
Sequence of actions.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,274-->

### A PDDL state is defined as a **Conjunction** of what?
?
A state in PDDL is a conjunction of **ground atomic fluents** $$block(A)\land block(B)\land clear(A) \land clear(B)$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### "ground atomic fluent", explain each word
?
- ground
	- because contains no variable
- atomic
	- single literal
- fluent
	- fact that changes over time
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

### How literals are connected in a precondition?
In a precondition, literals are connected by AND (conjunction of literals)
![[Drawing 2026-01-17 10.51.57.excalidraw]]

### What's the purpose of action's precondition?
What's need to be true in the current state for the action to be **applicable**.
![[Drawing 2026-01-17 10.51.57.excalidraw]]

### In which place are used variables in an action schema?
In the list of variables involved in the action.

### How literals are connected in an effect?
In an effect, literals are connected by AND (conjunction of literals)
![[Drawing 2026-01-17 10.51.57.excalidraw]]

### What's the purpose of action's effect?
The effect 
- specifies how the state $s$ of the world changes after the action $a$ is executed.
- by listing the literals to be added or deleted

### What's the difference between an "action" and a "ground action"?
?
The action contains variables, the ground action has the same variables assigned.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

### What constitutes a Planning **Domain** (vs. a Problem)?
?
A planning domain is made by a set of actions schema.
- it defines the general rule of the environment
	- valid for all problems
- a problem adds to the planning domain initial state and goal state.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

### How is the Initial State represented in PDDL?
?
As a conjunction of ground atomic fluents (a list of specific facts that are true at the start).
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

### How a goal state is defined?
?
It's a conjunction of literals $$At(\text{Flavio}, PI)\land \lnot(\text{Flavio}, SR)$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

### Given an action with precondition $P$, the action is **applicable** in a state $S$ if and only if [BLANK]
?
$S\vDash P$, so the current state $S$ satisfies the preconditions $P$
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### $S\vDash P$, what implies to $P$ literals?
?
- Every positive literal in $P$ must also hold in $S$
- Every negated literal in $P$ must NOT be present in $S$
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### After taking an action, what's the result? hint: $S' = Result(S,a)$
?
$$S' = Result(S,a) = (S \setminus \text{DEL}(a)) \cup \text{ADD}(a)$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270--> 

#### What does contain the new state $S'$? hint: $S' = Result(S,a)$
?
$S'$ contains the previous state $S$
- without $a$ delete list (negative effects)
- with $a$ add list (positive effects)
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

### Which are the algorithms to to find the actual plan?
?
- Forward state-space search
- Backward search
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### What's the starting point of Forward state-space search?
Is the initial state of the problem.

#### What's the FOL operation that Forward state-space search apply?
Unification $$Unify(a,b)=\theta \iff a\theta = b\theta$$

#### In Forward Search, we **unify** the Current State against which part of the Action Schema?
?
We unify current state against the preconditions of each action schema. $$Unify(S, P_i)\quad i\in\text{ACTIONS}$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

#### In Forward state-space search, what do we do with the unification result?
?
Unification returns a **Substitution** $\theta$
- It returns a set of variable bindings $$\{x/A,y/B\}$$
- We apply this substitution to the Action Schema to generate the **ground applicable action**.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### Applying the unification substitution to an Action Schema results in a [BLANK] action.
?
**ground**. The substitution assigns values to variables.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

#### What's the last step of Forward state-space search?
?
We apply the applicable actions for $$S\vDash P_i\quad i\in\text{ACTIONS}$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250--> 

#### What's the starting point of Backward search?
?
The goal state of the problem
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

#### What actions are considered on Backward search?
Consider relevant actions only.

#### What's the main benefit of Backward search that Forward search doesn't have?
?
Apply any relevant action, so less useless state.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

####  When does the backward search end?
?
When the sequence reaches the initial state.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

#### Which algorithm, between Forward and Backward search, has the smallest branching factor? Why?
?
Backward search. Because considering just the relevant actions implies considering just relevant paths from initial state to the goal. ![[Pasted image 20260117175119.png]]
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

### What version of the problem involve a planning heuristic?
?
Relaxed problem
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

#### In "ignore precondition heuristic" what action is applicable? Why?
?
Every action is applicable. Because we drop preconditions, so the rule $$S\vDash P$$ doesn't hold anymore.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

#### In "ignore precondition heuristic" what literals are kept in action's effect?
?
In each action's effect are kept only literals present in the goal.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### What does the "Ignore Precondition" heuristic calculate to estimate the cost?
?
The minimum number of actions needed such that the union of the actions' effects satisfy the goal $$\min \#\text{Actions}\;s.t\;\left(\bigcup_{a} a.\text{effect}\right)\vDash \text{Goal}$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### The "ignore precondition heuristic" is admissible? Why or Why not?
?
Yes, because it always underestimates the solution length.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### In "ignore delete list heuristic" which literals are removed from actions' effect? Why?
?
All negative literals from action's effect. So the next state $S'$ will be $$S' = Result(S,a) = (S \cancel{\setminus \text{DEL}(a)}) \cup \text{ADD}(a)$$ $$S' = S \cup \text{ADD}(a)$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

#### How search space is effected by "ignore delete list" heuristic?
?
The search space becomes much "smoother" to traverse. Which is why **Hill-Climbing** works well on this specific relaxed version.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### What does "ignore delete list heuristic" prevents?
?
It prevents actions from undoing previous steps
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### How progress towards goal is effected by "ignore delete list" heuristic?
Progress is **monotonic**: once a requirement is satisfied, it stays satisfied forever.

#### The "ignore delete list heuristic" is admissible? Why or Why not?
?
No, can lead to suboptimal solution.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,274-->

### What is pruning?
?
Is a technique that reduce search space by cutting out useless branches.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

#### What kind of pruning PDDL applies?
?
1. Symmetry reduction
2. Forward pruning
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,230-->

#### What "symmetry reduction" prunes out?
?
Prunes out all symmetric branches of the tree, leaving just one of them.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### Does "symmetry reduction" pruning reduce the search space?
?
Yes, it cuts branches.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254--> 

#### Which branches are pruned away in "forward pruning"?
?
Prunes out branches based on a preferred action.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,230-->

#### Is "Forward Pruning" admissible?
?
No, following a relaxed plan can prune out the optimal solution.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### Does the state space **become smaller** when using heuristics that work on actions? Why?
?
No, the size of the state space is unchanged. Because these heuristics modify the transitions (edges) between states
- making actions easier to execute 
- but they do not remove the states (nodes) themselves.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### Which mapping is applied in "state abstraction" heuristic?
Many to one mapping from states to abstract representation ![[Drawing 2026-01-17 18.17.27.excalidraw]] State 1 and 2 are treated the same, not state 3.

#### What does "state abstraction" heuristic removes? hint: less...
?
Remove fluents to get an approximate solution $$\text{less states}\implies\text{less steps}$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,230-->

#### Is it possible to divide a problem into independently subproblems (each one with a subgoal)? If yes, unite subproblem solutions costs the same of the single problem solution?
?
- Yes, is possible
	- It's the decomposition heuristic.
- No, it does not cost the same
	- subplans might contain redundant actions or conflict with each other
	- leading to a suboptimal merged plan
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### Is the "decomposition" heuristic admissible? Why and why not?
No, is not admissible. Can lead to longer solution because of overlapping actions.

### What's the purpose of hierarchical planning?
?
Mitigate explosion of action in the final plan. A simple task can explode in thousand of tiny step.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### How High Level Action (HLA) simplifies the planning?
?
Can abstract a simple actions sequence into one action. $$Take(train1, train2)\ldots Take(train_{n-1}, train_{n}) = Take(train)$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### What is an HLA refinement?
?
A refinement is a **replacement** of a High-Level Action (HLA) with a specific sequence of primitive actions (or other HLAs) that accomplish it. $$Go(Home,Rome)\sim[Drive(Station),\;Take(Train),\;Taxi(Hotel)]$$
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,250-->

#### What is High Level Plan made of?
?
High Level Plan is a sequence of High Level Action.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

#### When does the High Level Plan achieve the goal?
?
HLP achieves the goal if at least one of its implementations achieves the goal
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### Which search algorithm is used in Hierarchical forward planning? What is searching and in which plan? hint: start from simplest HLP...
?
HLP uses BFS to find possible refinements of each HLA in the current plan.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,230-->

### In which environment is useful Online planning? Why?
?
Nondeterministic environments.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

#### In "Action monitoring" approach, what does the agent verify before executing an action?
?
The agent verifies that preconditions still hold.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### In "Plan monitoring" approach, what does the agent verify before executing an action?
?
The agent verifies that the remaining plan will still succeed.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### In "Goal monitoring" approach, what does the agent verify before executing an action?
?
The agent checks to see if there is a better set of goals it could be trying to achieve.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

### Scheduling & Time
#### Why time matters in scheduling planning?
?
Time represents how long an action takes and when it occurs.
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,270-->

#### In scheduling planning which constraints do actions have?
?
One obvious constraint is the ordering of execution.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### In scheduling planning what are resources characteristics?
?
Actions characteristics are
- type of resource
- number of resources
- resource as consumable or reusable
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,230-->

#### What's a partial order plan?
?
Is a path in a directed graph that allows multiple actions to be take in parallel from state "start" to "goal".
<!--SR:!2026-01-22,4,274-->

#### What is the **critical path** in a scheduling problem?
?
The critical path is the path with the longest total duration.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,230-->

#### What determines the duration of the entire plan?
?
The critical path total duration.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### What is a slack? Which actions have it?
?
Is a window of time that have actions off the critical path.
<!--SR:!2026-01-19,1,234-->

#### How start time is modeled in slack?
A slack has two values:
- Earliest possible start time $ES$
- Latest possible start time $LS$
  
The window value is $LS-ES$

#### Which greedy heuristic works well with scheduling problem?
?
All slack heuristics. Especially **minimum slack heuristic**.
<!--SR:!2026-01-21,3,254-->

#### In minimum slack heuristic, which action is scheduled first and which is scheduled last?
?
On each iteration, it selects the unscheduled action that has:
1. All predecessors already scheduled.
2. The **least slack**. ![[Pasted image 20260118101502.png]]
>It then schedules that action at its **earliest possible start time (ES)**.
