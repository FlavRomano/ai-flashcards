## First order logic

### Why FOL is more powerful than Propositional logic? 

### What syntax construct we have in FOL?

### How do we call sentences in FOL?

#### What are terms?

#### What is an Atomic Sentence?

#### What is a Complex Sentence?

### What 3 components make up a Model in FOL?
### What is an interpretation?
### What's the value of a sentence wrt a given model and interpretation?

### What's the Closed-world assumption?

### Is it possible to check entailment via enumeration in FOL?

### Define the Universal Quantifier

### Define the Existential Quantifier

### What's quantifier duality?

### Knowledge Engineering
#### In Knowledge Engineering, what does "Deciding on a vocabulary" entail?
#### In the Knowledge Engineering process, what is the difference between **Encoding General Knowledge** and **Encoding the Problem Instance**?
#### What is the final step of Knowledge Engineering after asking queries?

### What is a substitution $\sigma$ in FOL?

### What is universal instantiation?
#### What happen to KB when we apply Universal Instantiation?

### What is existential instantiation?
#### Does applying Existential Instantiation (EI) produce a logically equivalent KB? Why or why not?
#### What is a Skolem Constant?
#### In which instantiation we use Skolem Constant and why?
#### Why can't we use an existing constant (like John) when performing Existential Instantiation?

### Is it possible to reduce FOL in Propositional Logic?

#### What's a ground sentence?

#### Does FOL propositionalization preserve entailment?

#### Why does the presence of Function Symbols make the number of ground terms infinite??

#### What is Herbrand's Theorem?

#### Why is FOL only **Semi-Decidable** according to Herbrand?

#### Does exists a theorem that guarantee finite proof via ground terms on sentence entailed by KB?

#### Why FOL entailment is Semi-Decidable?

### What's the downside of propositionalization in FOL?

#### How we can mitigate the propositionalization problem in FOL?

#### How does Unification allow us to skip the 'Reduction to Propositional Logic' step?

#### What's the limitation of unification in FOL?
#### Unification fails if the same variable name $(x)$ is used in both sentences for different values. What is the technique to fix this?

#### How Standardization in FOL?

#### What's Generalized Modus Ponens?
##### What does GMP leverage to deal with variables?

##### Why we use Unification in Generalized Modus Ponens?

##### Is Generalized Modus Ponens sound?

##### Is Generalized Modus Ponens complete?

### What's a definite clause?
#### Why we apply Generalized Modus Ponens to definite clause?
### How many ways exists to use GMP with Definite Clauses?

##### Is Backward Chaining sound?
##### Is Backward Chaining complete?
#### Which Chaining is more expensive?
### What's prolog?
#### How prolog works?
#### Prolog uses Backward Chaining. Under what condition is this algorithm incomplete?
#### What type of clauses does Prolog/GMP handle?
### Why do we need Resolution in FOL?
#### Is Resolution in FOL Complete and Sound?
#### How Resolution in FOL works?
#### Resolution proves $KB \vDash\alpha$ by showing that [BLANK] is unsatisfiable. 
#### Which sentences form Resolution in FOL requires?
#### What is the **first step** in converting a FOL sentence to CNF (regarding implications)?
#### When moving negation inwards in CNF conversion, how do **Quantifiers** change?
#### In CNF conversion, why do we Standardize Variables (e.g., renaming x to z in the second clause) before dropping quantifiers?
#### At last step of Resolution in FOL, what is the return value when a contradiction is found?
#### In CNF conversion, how do we handle Existential Quantifiers ($\exists$) that appear inside the scope of a Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)?
#### What is the final form of a sentence after CNF conversion (what connects the literals)?
#### At the end of CNF conversion, what happens to the **Universal Quantifiers** ($\forall$)?
### What's ontologies?
#### In Domain specific knowledge, which things can we define?
