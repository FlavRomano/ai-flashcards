# Artificial Life
## What's a complex system?
?
A complex system is a **system of systems** that has:
- **simple parts**
	- interactive with their neighbors
- **bottom up control**
	- no central unit
- **emergent behavior**
	- the system itself has patterns
	- that the simple part doesn't have

### What's adaptive complex system? 
?
Evolution of complexity, from apparently deterministic behavior to chaotic dynamics.

## What's Tierra?
?
Simulation in which creatures are self-replicating computer programs

### How competition in Tierra works?
?
Tierra's programs compete for
- CPU time
- RAM space

### How life evolved in Tierra?
?
Tierra wasn't complex, but life complexity emerged with evolution and adaptation:
- **parasitism**
	- program A use program B code to replicate
- **hyper-parasitism**
	- program A stole CPU's from program B
- **sociality**
	- program A and B cooperate and recombine to make program C

## What's Avida?
?
Like Tierra, is a simulation in which the organism are softwares. This time
- organism can ear more CPU
	- by performing mathematical tasks
- it emerged a fitness focused 
	- live long enough to do  something useful

## How logistic map get complex?
?
The logistic map equation is simple and yet predictable $$x_{t+1} = r x_t(1-x_t)$$ by tweaking the parameter $r$ the system moves from **steady** to **periodic** (pattern repetition) to **CHAOS** ![[Pasted image 20260108183505.png]]

### Deterministic rule have always predictable behaviour in Artificial Life context?
?
No, from the logistic map example we learn that 
- even simple and deterministic rules
	- can lead to **UNPREDICTABLE** behavior

## What's a cellular automata?
?
It's a grid of cells where 
- each cell changes state
	- based on a set of local Update Rules
### Which characteristics define a cellular automata?
?
- **Discrete Space**
	- grid of cells
	- e.g 1D a line, 2D chessboard ...
- **Discrete States**
	- a cell can only be in one of $k$ states at a time
	- e.g $k=2$, 0 dead or 1 alive
- **Discrete Time**
	- every cell updates simultaneously at every tick
- **Local Update Rules**
	- a cell looks a its immediate neighbors
	- doesn't know anything about the rest of the grid
### What's the simplest cellular automata?
?
The Elementary Cellular Automata.
#### What's Elementary CA?
?
It's the simplest cellular automata
- **Discrete Space** = 1D
- **Discrete States** = Dead 0 or Alive 1
- **Local update**, a cell looks at 3 things
	- itself
	- left neighbor
	- right neighbor
##### How Elementary CA decides if a cell will be 0 or 1? hint: Update rule
?
To decide if a cell will be 0 or 1 in the next step, it looks at 3 things: itself, its left neighbor and its right neighbor. $$s^j_{t+1} = f(s^{j-1}_t, s^{j}_t, s^{j+1}_t)$$ and follow a rule based on the bit string e.g 101=0, 001 = 1...

##### What are the possible configuration for a neighborhood?
?
Since 
- there are 3 cells in the neighborhood 
	- each has 2 possible states
- there are $$2^3 = 8$$ possible configurations
##### How the update rule works?
?
A rule defines an output
![[Pasted image 20260107182726.png]]
like a logic gate e.g 111=0, 110=1

##### How many possible Elementary CA rules exists?
?
Rule can be expressed by 8bit number, e.g 111. 
- we have $2^8=256$ possible Elementary CA rules

##### Considering reflection symmetry property, how many admissible Elementary CA rules exists?
?
From $2^8=256$ rules 
- by considering reflection symmetry
	- e.g 110 === 011
- rules collapse to just **$32$ admissible rule**
